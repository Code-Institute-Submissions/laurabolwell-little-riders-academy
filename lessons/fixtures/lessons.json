This is the first step of the learning to ride journey.\r\n\r\nBalance bikes are fantastic for developing children’s balance and basic skills to help them learn to ride alone,  quicker than using traditional stabilisers. Over a few sessions, riders will be able to scoot and glide, while having fun through an obstacle course, under the limbo pole and over ramps.\r\n\r\nChildren will need to be supported by a parent or carer.\r\n\r\nChildren are encouraged to bring their own helmet to this session. We have a limited number of helmets available which are cleaned before and after each session. \r\n\r\nStabilizers are not allowed / used during the session.",
